        <center><h2>Aim<br/></h2></center>
        <p>We aim to provide a videographical and photographical platform for various academic and non-academic activities of our Institute and students, and help to showcase it through social media. We aim to achieve this by creating Info-tainment rich videos of the different activities conducted in an ethical way such that they represent the ideals and principles of our institute and the viewers can inculcate those values in their lives.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <center><h2>Vision</h2></center>
        <p>To leave behind a motivating example and legacy to the Instituteâ€™s future aspirants and collect memories of our college journeys. Also to bring glory to the name of the instutute on an international level, by showcasing our morals on a world-wide platform. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <center><h2>Work</h2></center>
        <p>We hope to be a connecting cable for other clubs and find exposure and inspiration for our students by clicking pictures and creating videos. We would also hold workshops to promote the sense of photography, videography and editing in the students of our college and the art of showcasing the content. We at Iridescence believe that the skills that a person possesses become exponentially significant if shared with others. And we will help them to find the right exposure for their respective skills and also bring recognition to the college.
